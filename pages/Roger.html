        <h1>Roger Federer</h1>
        <p>Roger Federer (born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player 
            who is currently ranked world no. 2 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).
            Many commentators and players regard Federer as the greatest tennis player of all time. 
            Federer turned professional in 1998 and has been ranked inside the top 10 since October 2002.
            Federer holds several records of the Open Era: holding the world no. 1 position for 302 weeks
            (including 237 consecutive weeks); winning 17 Grand Slam singles titles; reaching each Grand 
            Slam final at least five times (an all-time record); and reaching the Wimbledon final nine times. 
            He is among the seven men (and among the four in Open Era) to capture a career Grand Slam.
            Federer shares an Open Era record for most titles at Wimbledon with Pete Sampras (7)
            and at the US Open with Jimmy Connors and Sampras (5).
            Federer appeared in 25 men's singles Grand Slam finals, with 10 in a row, 
            both records, and appeared in 18 of 19 finals from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships
            through to the 2010 Australian Open. He also recorded semi-finals at 23 consecutive 
            Grand Slam tournaments, from the 2004 Wimbledon Championships through the 2010 Australian Open.
            At the 2015 French Open, he played in a record 62nd consecutive Grand Slam tournament and 
            earlier at the 2014 US Open, reached a record 43rd Grand Slam quarterfinal and a record 36th Grand Slam semifinal.
            Prior to that, at the 2013 French Open, Federer reached a record 36th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal.
            Federer has won the most matches in Grand Slams (283) and is the first to record 60+ wins each at each Grand Slam tournament.</p>
        
        <p>Federer's ATP tournament records include winning a record 6 ATP World Tour Finals,
            playing in the finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments
            (a record shared with Djokovic and Nadal), and having won the most prize money of any player in history. 
            He also won the Olympic gold medal in doubles with his compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka at 
            the 2008 Summer Olympic Games and the Olympic silver medal in singles at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. 
            Representing Switzerland, he was a part of the 2014 winning Davis Cup team. He spent eight years (2003–2010) 
            continuously in the top 2 in the year-end men's rankings and ten (2003–2012) in the top 3. 
            He was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year for a record four consecutive years (2005–2008).</p>
