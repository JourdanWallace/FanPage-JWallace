        <h1>Novak Djokovic</h1>
        <p>Novak Djokovic (born 22 May 1987) is a Serbian professional tennis player 
            who is currently ranked world No. 1 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).
            He is considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time.
            Djokovic has won eight Grand Slam singles titles and has held the No. 1 spot 
            in the ATP rankings for a total of 148 weeks. By winning three Grand Slam titles in 2011,
            Djokovic became the sixth male player to win three Grand Slams in a calendar year. 
            By reaching the 2012 French Open final, he became the ninth player in the Open Era 
            to reach the final of all four Grand Slam singles tournaments and became only the 
            fifth to do so consecutively. Amongst other titles, he won the ATP World Tour Finals 
            in 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2014 and was on the Serbian team which won the 2010 Davis Cup. 
            He also won the Bronze medal in men's singles at the 2008 Summer Olympics. 
            He has won 24 Masters 1000 series titles, breaking a single-season record with five titles in 2011.
            This places him second on the list of Masters 1000 winners since its inception in 1990.</p>
        <p>He holds several men's world records of the Open Era: becoming the youngest player in the Open Era 
            to have reached the semi-finals of all four Grand Slam events both separately and consecutively; 
            the first and only man to win three consecutive Australian Open titles in the Open Era, as well as 
            the only man in the Open Era to win 5 Australian Open titles overall; and playing the longest 
            Grand Slam men's singles final in history (5 hours 53 minutes). Djokovic's ATP tournament records 
            include winning 31 consecutive ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series matches, playing in the finals 
            at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (a record shared by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal), 
            and being the only player to win eight. Djokovic holds the best winning percentage (83.33%) at 
            hard court matches and the only player in the Open Era to win first three masters in a year 
            (2015: Indian Wells, Miami Open and Monte Carlo).
            Djokovic is the first Serbian player to win multiple Grand Slams and the first Serbian player to rank No. 1 
            for more than 100 weeks. He is the first male player representing Serbia to win a Grand Slam singles title.
            Djokovic has won numerous awards, including the 2012 and 2015 Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year
            and the 2012 and 2013 Best Male Tennis Player ESPY Award. He has won the ATP World Tour Player of the Year
            three times - in 2011, 2012 and 2014, and the ITF World Champion award four times consecutively, from 2011 to 2014. 
            He is a recipient of the Order of St. Sava and the Order of the Star of Karađorđe.</p>
