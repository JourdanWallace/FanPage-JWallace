        <h1>Serena Williams</h1>
        <p>Serena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981) is an American professional tennis player who is currently ranked No. 1 in women's singles tennis. 
            The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has ranked her World No. 1 in singles on six separate occasions. 
            She became the World No. 1 for the first time on July 8, 2002, and regained this ranking for the sixth time on February 18, 2013, becoming the oldest world no. 1 player in WTA's history.
            Williams is also regarded by some experts and former tennis players to be the greatest female tennis player in history.
            She is the only female player to have won over $60 million in prize money, and is the reigning Australian Open, US Open, WTA Tour Championships and Olympic ladies singles champion</p>
        <p>Frequently hailed as the Queen of the Court by the general media, Williams holds the most major singles, doubles, and mixed doubles titles combined amongst active players, male or female. 
            Her record of 34 Grand Slam titles puts her seventh on the all-time list: 19 in singles, 13 in women's doubles, and 2 in mixed doubles. 
            She is the most recent player, male or female, to have held all four Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously (2002–03), and the fifth woman ever to do so. 
            She is also the most recent player together with her sister Venus Williams to have held all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles simultaneously (2009–10). 
            Her total of 19 Grand Slam singles titles is tied for third on the all-time list with Helen Wills Moody behind Margaret Court (24 titles) and Steffi Graf (22 titles), and second in the Open Era, behind only Graf.
            She has won 13 Grand Slam doubles titles with her sister Venus and the pair are unbeaten in Grand Slam finals.
            Serena Williams is also a five-time winner of the WTA Tour Championships.
            The arrival of Venus and Serena Williams has been credited with launching a new era of power in women's tennis. 
            Williams has won four Olympic gold medals, one in women's singles and three in women's doubles, an all-time record shared with her sister Venus.</p>
